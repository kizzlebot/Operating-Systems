# Parallel Processing
- Two or more processes running at the same time on one system.
    - May or may not process related processes
- Two or more CPUs execute instructions simultaneously
- Benefits
    - Increased reliability
    - Faster processing
    - Faster processing methods
        - CPU allocated to each program or job
        - CPU allocated to each working set or part of it
        - Individual instructions are subdivided
- Challenges
    - Connecting process into configurations
    - Orchestrating processor interaction
